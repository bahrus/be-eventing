# be-eventing (üèá)

Minimal CSP security rules stipulate that inline event handlers are "out of bounds" as far as guaranteeing safety.

This enhancement is designed to live within those (excessively?) tight constraints, and still be able to attach event handlers "locally" without requiring a framework or custom element host that has to micromanage everything -- leading to tight coupling.

Whereas attaching an event handler using a unique id may work outside the shadow DOM, it doesn't work very well with repeating content, especially inside Shadow Roots.  This, in my view, is driving a stake through progressive enhancement.

This enhancement endeavors to blunt the edge of that stake.

```html
<button disabled>My Button</button>
<script be-eventing>document.currentScript.on={
    click: e => console.log({e})
}</script>
```

or

```html
<button disabled>My Button</button>
<script üèá>document.currentScript.on={
    click: e => console.log({e})
}</script>

```

Either one attaches the click event handler to the previous element sibling (button in this case) by default.

If "disabled" is a property of the element being eventing, it nudges the attribute -- basically removing it.

## un-deferring

*be-eventing* can also "nudge" "defer-[enhancementBase]" attributes:

```html
<ways-of-science itemscope>
    <carrot-nosed-woman></carrot-nosed-woman>
    <a-duck></a-duck>
    <template
        defer-be-switched
        be-switched='On based on ~carrotNosedWoman::weight-change and ~aDuck::molting.'
    >
        <div>A witch!</div>
        <div>Burn her!</div>
    </template>
    <script üèá=be-switched>document.currentScript.on={
        change: e => e.r = Math.abs(e.f.carrotNosedWoman - e.f.aDuck) < 10
    }</script>
</ways-of-science>
```

What this does, precisely [TODO]:

1.  Finds Mount Observer Script Element (MOSE) with id:  "be-hive.be-switched" within the shadow realm
2.  Gets the enhKey
3.  Filters out events that don't match the enhKey
4.  Attaches the enhanced event listener to the previous non script element sibling.
5.  "Nudges" the defer-be-switched (eliminating it if there's no numeric value or it has value="1", otherwise decrements the number)
